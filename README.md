# coronavirusinformatics

In light of urgency provoked by Covid-19, this repository is inaugurated, in order to ask the question:

What can bioinformatics do to help in the current (March 2020) Covid-19 outbreak?

Well, does bioinformatics usually handle?

Most bioinformaticians would have come across a definition of their role as glorified file format converters. And actually
this has much more than a grain of truth in it, and probably isn't a bad summary.

It doesn't sound like much but in fact, when converting file formats, alot is going on behind the scenes:

* testing the source file for proper formatting.
* duplicate-handling is probably required.
* missing data must be treated somehow
